# Welcome to My Portfolio!

This is a portfolio website I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

**Here, you will find:**
- Information about my background, experiences, and hobbies.
- A summary of the skills that I have mastered.
- A detailed showcase of my coding projects.
- Ways to get in contact with me.

**Skills enhanced:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, front-end development, and web design.

Work still in Progress!
